# Build stage
# Pinned to the BUILD platform, not the target: the image is published
# multi-arch, and letting the toolchain stage run under QEMU emulation to
# produce an arm64 binary is minutes of emulated compilation for no reason. Go
# cross-compiles natively instead, driven by the TARGET* args buildx injects.
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM golang:1.27-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /build

# Supplied per target platform. The defaults keep a plain `docker build` (a
# local one-off, no --platform) working: TARGETARCH resolves empty there, and
# an empty GOARCH means "host default", which is what that build wants anyway.
#
# BuildKit is required either way — `$BUILDPLATFORM` on the FROM above is a
# BuildKit-only variable, and the legacy builder fails to parse the line rather
# than ignoring it. That is the default builder since Docker 23, so this only
# bites an explicit DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0.
